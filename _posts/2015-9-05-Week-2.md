title: First week in OOP
---

Week 1 is done! So far the material in the class hasn't been too tricky, given that I've been paying attention in class. Hopefully
that bodes well for the semester. We've been discussing a lot of the optimizations for this project, and so far they all seem simple to understand,
but I'm not very confident that I would have come up with them very quickly, if at all. It makes me wonder how many little things
like that I've missed in the past, and especially how to figure those out in the future. There has to be a way of thinking about
these things to discover these optimizations...
Apart from that, I'd say the "little" thing I learned (In quotes because it is simple to understand, and didn't take long to learn, but will
still be useful in the future) is demotion and promotion of data types, and which calls are legal in Java vs C++. Basically
C++ will let you get away with a lot of shady stuff.

Tip of the week: Start early on the projects! I didn't start as early as I would have liked, but still started early enough so I could 
break up the project into pieces, and after I felt worn out I would take a break, because I don't have a deadline breathing down
my neck. I know for me personally, whenever I get worn out or tired I start getting very sloppy and making a lot of dumb mistakes,
so it's definitely a good idea to minimize that.
