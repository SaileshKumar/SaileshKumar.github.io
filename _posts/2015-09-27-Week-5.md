title: Week 5
---

This week was very light for me, with career fair on Monday, the presentation on Wednesday, and then I missed class on Friday for an interview.
Not gonna lie, I'm a little worried about how I can catch up on the material I missed on Friday, but hopefully I can meet up with
some friends in the class and learn the material enough to keep up with the pace of the class. Aside from that, I don't have
too much to discuss about the actual contents of the class.

The project got a lot easier when we were implementing the efficient version, with the classes for Candidate and Ballot. I think part of
it was we broke up the logic into several smaller parts, and made sure to test as we went along. Overall, the procedures just seemed significantly
more intuitive when we had that logical structure with the Candidates and Ballots. I also started using vectors, which was a big
help in terms of not worrying about resizing.

Career fair went alright, I didn't hand out too many resumes. It's kind of funny how different career fair is when you're a freshman
vs. when you're a junior. For most of the companies I'm interested in, I know someone who worked there and can get an email of
a recruiter, which is a lot more attractive than standing in line in a stressful situation.

Tip of the week: Think through your code! You'll be happy later on. Break it up into parts, and try and design code that is intuitive 
to not only write, but understand and debug.
